# YouTube.Clone
For for this project I chose to make a clone of <b> YouTube </b>
<br/>
No JavaScript code is implied here because i wanted to master <b>HTML </b>and<b> CSS </b>.
<br/>
At first sight the <b>YouToube.Clone</b> looks exactly like the original, but the videos are added manually and are only a few.
<br/>
The buttons are styled very pleasant for the user experience and the tinny elements of the headbar have their own description.
